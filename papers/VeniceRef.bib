	abstract = {Traversability, a relatively new concept in the field of space syntax study, was introduced by Hillier
(2019) in his last paper, measuring the ease with which a layout can be traversed as a whole
without crossing the same space twice. In his preliminary comparison of the traversability value
of four structure types (a-. b-. c- and d-structures), Hillier argued that the understanding of
traversability in graph structures, regarding its functional effects and social meanings, will
contribute to the enrichment of space syntax theory. Taking Hillier’s work as a starting point, this
paper provides a more in-depth exploration of traversability in four dimensions. a. providing
mathematical evaluations of the traversability value in a-, b-, c- and d-structure with the number
of nodes ranging from four (the minimum number of nodes to form a d-structure) to n; b. conducting
experiments with how changes in local spatial relationships may affect the global value of
traversability in a configuration, thereby illustrating the architectural implications of the measure;
c. classifying distinctions in social meanings between spatial configurations with high and low
traversability values. This analytic is based on comparing traversability values with established
classifications of layouts in space syntax research using the conceptual/analytical pairs of high/low
integration and strong/weak programmes (Hillier 1996); d. measuring and comparing
traversability values of real-world layouts using a python programme developed for this study. We argue that these four dimensions of analysis highlight the significance of this new measure; we
also explain what they add to existing applications of space syntax analysis. The paper concludes
with directions for the future exploration of this new measure and possible applications in practical
fields.},

	abstract = {The science of cities seeks to understand and explain regularities observed in the world’s major urban systems. Modelling the population evolution of cities is at the core of this science and of all urban studies. Quantitatively, the most fundamental problem is to understand the hierarchical organization of city population and the statistical occurrence of megacities. This was first thought to be described by a universal principle known as Zipf’s law1,2; however, the validity of this model has been challenged by recent empirical studies3,4. A theoretical model must also be able to explain the relatively frequent rises and falls of cities and civilizations5, but despite many attempts6–10 these fundamental questions have not yet been satisfactorily answered. Here we introduce a stochastic equation for modelling population growth in cities, constructed from an empirical analysis of recent datasets (for Canada, France, the UK and the USA). This model reveals how rare, but large, interurban migratory shocks dominate city growth. This equation predicts a complex shape for the distribution of city populations and shows that, owing to finite-time effects, Zipf’s law does not hold in general, implying a more complex organization of cities. It also predicts the existence of multiple temporal variations in the city hierarchy, in agreement with observations5. Our result underlines the importance of rare events in the evolution of complex systems11 and, at a more practical level, in urban planning.},

Are existing boundaries between disciplines such as architecture, planning and landscape design enriching or constraining heritage? This paper analyses the urban morphology of Venice and the Piazza San Marco, a key context in which architecture emerges as legitimised vehicle for urban regeneration in early modernity. Looking at the relationship between the Piazza and the urban networks of Venice alongside intangible spatial practices and symbols, the paper makes three contributions to urban conservation: a) it defines the HUL as the interrelationship of the anonymous city with the authored products of design, b) it revisits the foundations of early modern consciousness about architecture, urban conservation and innovation in order to better understand interdisciplinary knowledge in the heritage sector and c) it approaches heritage as social construction, involving the selection of structures, from buildings to entire areas, and from legal documents and political instruments to ideologies through which societies are seen from dominant positions, often disguising conflict.},

	abstract = {This study compares the urban form of large European cities using fractal dimensions. Fractal dimensions are computed for built-up areas using data available in the Imperviousness High Resolution Layer dataset (EEA, 2012), and are estimated following two different methodologies; the binary approach which considers only two classes, developed land and non-developed land and the grayscale approach in which the built-up intensity, as expressed by the soil sealing degree is explicitly taken into account. Fractal dimensions are estimated for the 60 European cities with population exceeding one million. Using the boundaries defined in Urban Atlas the functional urban Area (FUA) is divided in two parts, the core of the urban area and the peri-urban ring area. Fractal dimensions are computed for each of these three spatial entities. Results show that the grayscale fractal dimension values at the FUA level are 1.18-1.55 and that the equivalent binary ones are always higher with values between 1.34 and 1.83. There is a high correlation between the two sets of fractal dimensions, as well as between the fractal dimension and the overall percentage of built-up area. Cities are also compared across regions (UK-Ireland, Scandinavia, Central, South, East). Significantly higher fractal values at the FUA level are reported in the cities located on the highly urbanized European corridor spanning from South UK to the Netherlands, Belgium, the Ruhr region and Northern Italy, while East European and Scandinavian cities form a distinct group with lower fractal dimension values.  Another group of cities with high FUA fractal dimensions includes the coastal South European cities Porto, Lisbon, Naples and Barcelona. At the CΟRΕ urban areas, the highest fractal values are observed in the largest cities (London, Paris, Berlin) which are compactly built-up.},

Moreover, a time lag between the mobility decrease and introduction of lockdown measures is detected, suggesting that the latter is not the reason for people to reduce movement. Further, the mobility reduction is found less significant on Parks and appeared earlier on Transit Stations.

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

	abstract = {Cellular automata (CA) have been increasingly used in simulating urban expansion and land-use dynamics. However, most urban CA models rely on empirical data for deriving transition rules, assuming that the historical trend will continue into the future. Such inertia CA models do not take into account possible external interventions, particularly planning policies, and thus have rarely been used in urban and land-use planning. This paper proposes to use artificial immune systems (AIS) as a technique for incorporating external interventions and generating alternatives in urban simulation. Inspired by biological immune systems, the primary process of AIS is the evolution of a set of ‘antibodies’ that are capable of learning through interactions with a set of sample ‘antigens’. These ‘antibodies’ finally get ‘matured’ and can be used to identify/classify other ‘antigens’. An AIS-based CA model incorporates planning policies by altering the evolution mechanism of the ‘antibodies’. Such a model is capable of generating different scenarios of urban development under different land-use policies, with which the planners will be able to answer ‘what if’ questions and to evaluate different options. We applied an AIS-based CA model to the simulation of urban agglomeration development in the Pearl River Delta in southern China. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can be very useful in exploring various planning scenarios of urban development.},

	abstract = {Antibodies result from the competition of B cell lineages evolving under selection for improved antigen recognition, a process known as affinity maturation. High-affinity antibodies to pathogens such as HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 are frequently reported to arise from B cells whose receptors, the precursors to antibodies, are encoded by particular immunoglobulin alleles. This raises the possibility that the presence of particular germline alleles in the B cell repertoire is a major determinant of the quality of the antibody response. Alternatively, initial differences in germline alleles’ propensities to form high-affinity receptors might be overcome by chance events during affinity maturation. We first investigate these scenarios in simulations: when germline-encoded fitness differences are large relative to the rate and effect size variation of somatic mutations, the same germline alleles persistently dominate the response of different individuals. In contrast, if germline-encoded advantages can be easily overcome by subsequent mutations, allele usage becomes increasingly divergent over time, a pattern we then observe in mice experimentally infected with influenza virus. We investigated whether affinity maturation might nonetheless strongly select for particular amino acid motifs across diverse genetic backgrounds, but we found no evidence of convergence to similar CDR3 sequences or amino acid substitutions. These results suggest that although germline-encoded specificities can lead to similar immune responses between individuals, diverse evolutionary routes to high affinity limit the genetic predictability of responses to infection and vaccination.},

It is suggested, on the basis of the Near Eastern archaeological evidence from the eighth to sixth millennia BC, that early signs of urban concepts may be found at this stage. These signs show the development of ‘functionally hierarchical’ concepts reﬂected in domestic architecture and settlement planning. At least from the cognitive point of view, these concepts may be on the direct trajectory towards the full-blown urban centres of the fourth and third millennia BC in the Near East.},

	abstract = {Spatial structure is hypothesized to be an important factor in the origin of life, wherein encapsulated chemical reaction networks came together to form systems capable adaptive complexification via Darwinian evolution. In this work, we use a computational model to investigate how different patterns of environmental connectivity influence the emergence of adaptive processes in simulated systems of self-amplifying networks of interacting chemical reactions (autocatalytic cycles, ``ACs''). Specifically, we measured the propensity for adaptive dynamics to emerge in communities with nine distinct patterns of inter-AC interactions, across ten different patterns of environmental connectivity. We found that the pattern of connectivity can dramatically influence the emergence of adaptive processes; however, the effect of any particular spatial pattern varied across systems of ACs. Relative to a well-mixed (fully connected) environment, each spatial structure that we investigated amplified adaptive processes for at least one system of ACs and suppressed adaptive processes for at least one other system. Our findings suggest that there may be no single environment that universally promotes the emergence of adaptive processes in a system of interacting components (e.g., ACs). Instead, the ideal environment for amplifying (or suppressing) adaptive dynamics will depend on the particularities of the system.},

	abstract = {Angular street segment measures are used to analyse the degree to which network intelligibility
of cities becomes evident at different scales. It is shown that the phenomenon is not scaleinvariant, but has a distinct peak at which correlations are highest, providing a recognisable
scale of any given city map that results from its broad network structure rather than individual
features such as mean street length. For actual street networks it is found that this scale
corresponds with the radius at which Syntax measures such as choice best predict human
movement within the city.
These results may explain the relationship between individual navigation strategies and urban
form, and why Space Syntax techniques as different as centrality measures and agent simulation
should both be effective in predicting movement. Syntactic intelligibility appears to operate at a
particular radius around 2-4km; at this scale, both a perfectly informed strategy of route
minimisation (network centrality measures) and a locally opportunistic navigation (stochastic
agent simulations) yield similar patterns. Empirical evidence indicates this is the scale at which
both correlate with observed movement and of an average journey length. The networks
examined can thus be considered to be optimised to convey the most relevant information on
likely journeys to navigators throughout the network, and to do it at the most useful scale.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

	abstract = {Community structure and its detection in complex networks has been the subject of many studies in the recent years. Towards this goal, we have created a novel approach based on the analysis of the motion of a memory-biased random walker, i.e. an entity that traverses the network with some tendency to follow or avoid pathways it has previously traversed. We found that the walker tends to remain inside communities, that is, subsets of the network nodes which are more connected to each other, rather than to the rest of the network. Based on this trait of the MBRW we developed a method to detect communities and tested its performance on a range of networks with different levels of community structure. In all tested cases, the method proved to be at least as effective as Girvan‚ÄìNewman or Infomap while outperforming them when communities were less well defined.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accumulating evidence suggests that biological systems are composed of interacting, separable, functional modules. Identifying these modules is essential to understand the organization of biological systems.Result: In this paper, we present a framework to identify modules within biological networks. In this approach, the concept of degree is extended from the single vertex to the sub-graph, and a formal definition of module in a network is used. A new agglomerative algorithm was developed to identify modules from the network by combining the new module definition with the relative edge order generated by the Girvan-Newman (G-N) algorithm. A JAVA program, MoNet, was developed to implement the algorithm. Applying MoNet to the yeast core protein interaction network from the database of interacting proteins (DIP) identified 86 simple modules with sizes larger than three proteins. The modules obtained are significantly enriched in proteins with related biological process Gene Ontology terms. A comparison between the MoNet modules and modules defined by Radicchi et al. (2004) indicates that MoNet modules show stronger co-clustering of related genes and are more robust to ties in betweenness values. Further, the MoNet output retains the adjacent relationships between modules and allows the construction of an interaction web of modules providing insight regarding the relationships between different functional modules. Thus, MoNet provides an objective approach to understand the organization and interactions of biological processes in cellular systems.Availability: MoNet is available upon request from the authors.Contact:luofeng@cs.clemson.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
